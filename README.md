Welcome to the NextJS base template bootstrapped using the `create-next-app`. This template supports TypeScript, but you can use normal JavaScript as well.

## Getting Started

### Environment Setup

This project uses environment variables for configuration. To get started:

1. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   
2. Edit the `.env` file with your own URLs, links, and configuration values.

The environment variables are used for social media links, media URLs, and site configuration.

Hit the run button to start the development server.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on `/api/hello`. This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Productionizing your Next App

To make your next App run smoothly in production make sure to deploy your project with [Repl Deployments](https://docs.replit.com/hosting/deployments/about-deployments)!

You can also produce a production build by running `npm run build` and [changing the run command](https://docs.replit.com/programming-ide/configuring-repl#run) to `npm run start`.
