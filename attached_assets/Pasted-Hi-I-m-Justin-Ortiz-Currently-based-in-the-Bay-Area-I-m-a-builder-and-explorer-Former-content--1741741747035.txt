Hi, I’m Justin Ortiz

Currently based in the Bay Area.

I’m a builder and explorer.

Former content creator and athletic trainer.

I am a sports medicine practitioner by trade but a techie at heart.

On a journey to a new career in Business Operations and Product Management

**Journey**

I began my career in athletic training, driven by a fascination with human movement and rehabilitation. Over the years, I’ve been privileged to work in incredible environments, including Drum Corps International, high schools, the NFL, NCAA Division I, and the MLS. These experiences taught me invaluable lessons—mastering a craft, attention to detail, and the power of grit—all of which I now apply to other areas of interest.

After 10 years in sports medicine, I’m ready to embark on a new path. My current focus is on sports science, data analytics, and the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence. I’m dedicating this time to developing new skills and exploring the opportunities that lie ahead.

**Philosophy**

Throughout my life and career, I’ve been guided by two simple creeds: efficiency and care.

During my college days, I worked in the service industry. One instructor challenged me with a pivotal question: “How can I accomplish the same amount of tasks in fewer steps?” This mindset reshaped my approach to everything I do. While perfection is a journey, practice and repetition ensure the process becomes more refined over time.

The second principle is to care.

I take pride in my work, whether it’s through attentive interactions with patients, dedicating time to those in need, or handling even the smallest tasks with effort and intention.

**Creator**

From my philosophy comes balance. Like many, my professional life has taken twists and turns. A career is just one chapter in life’s story; it doesn’t define me entirely. [My hobbies](https://justinortizcreatives.com/) filled in the gaps and learned life lessons to help shape my worldview.
